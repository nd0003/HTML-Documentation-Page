      <h2>Introduction To HTML</h2>
    </header>
    <article>
      <p>
        HTML is the language that every website on the internet is written in (including this one). HTML stands for HyperT ext Markup language and was created by a
        group named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATWG">WHATWG</a> in 1993. HTML on its own is not very useful however, as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS) needs to be applied in order for the website to look nice. While CSS is
        important, we will mainly be focusing on HTML here.
        <br>
        Similar to all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language">Standard Generalised Markup Languages</a> (SGMLs), HTML uses
        opening tags (&lt;tag>) and closing tags (&lt;/tag>). A commonly used tag in HTML is the &lt;p> tag. This tag is used to display text on a website. Below is an
        example of how the &lt;p> tag is used in HTML.
        <br>
        <code>
          &lt;p>This is an example of an HTML paragraph.&lt;/p>
        </code>
        <br>
        When a website's code has been written and the website is ready to go on the internet, the HTML and CSS are published to a web-host. This means that the code
        gets sent to the URL and when you visit the website you will be able to see the content of it, as the browser has processed the code for you.

        This guide expects that you already know/have the following:
      <ul>
        <li>How the internet and World Wide Web (WWW) works (If you are planning on publishing your website).</li>
        <li>Basic experience with computers.</li>

      <h2>Text Editors</h2>
    </header>
    <article>
      <p>
        HTML is written in a software called a text editor. Most computers have built-in text editors, but there are more advanced text editors used by web developers
        to make things easier for them. When practicing HTML for the first time, it is recommended to use a basic text editor like Notepad on Windows, or TextEdit
        for MacOS (Notepad come with Windows for free and TextEdit comes with MacOS for free). It is recommended to use these when starting out because you have to
        manually type out everything, and you will learn much better from your mistakes. Once you have learnt at least the basics of HTML, (Important tags, how the
        language works, etc) you can switch to a more advanced text editor if you wish to, but it is not required. Below is a list of text editors which HTML can be
        written in.
      <ul>
        <li>Notepad</li>
        <li>TextEdit</li>
        <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
        <li>Sublime Text</li>
        <li>Notepad++</li>
        <li>Atom</li>
        <li>CoffeeCup</li>
        <li>DreamWeaver</li>
      </ul>
      You're probably also wondering which one my favourite is, and which one I recommend. As I said before, I recommend Notepad or TextEdit when you're starting out, but one you have developed your skills a bit, I would recommend switching to Visual Studio Code, which is my favourite one. However, if you prefer another text
      editor, that's completely fine.

      <h2>HTML Headings</h2>
    </header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Headings in HTML are defined using numbers 1-6, with 1 being the largest leading and 2 being the smallest heading. Below is an example of what the headings all
        look like.
        <br>
      <div>
        <h1>Heading 1</h1>
        <h2>Heading 2</h2>
        <h3>Heading 3</h3>
        <h4>Heading 4</h4>
        <h5>Heading 5</h5>
        <h6>Heading 6</h6>
      </div>
      <br>
      These headings are defined using &lt;h> tags. For example, if you wanted to create a heading that says "Example" in heading size 4, you would write the
      following code:
      <br>
      <code>
        &lt;h4>Example&lt;h4>
      </code>
      <br>
      Writing the code above would result in the output below:
      <br>
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <br>
      Well done! Feel free to practice headings as much as you want.

      <h2>HTML Hyperlinks</h2>
    </header>
    <article>
      <p>
        You can hyperlink text in HTML, similar to Word or Google Docs. This is done by adding the anchor tag (&lt;a>) to the text you would like to hyperlink.
        (Example below).
        <br><br>
        <code>
          &lt;p>This is an example paragraph. I would like to link &lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/nd03">this&lt;/a> to my FCC profile.&lt;/p>

        <br>
        This code would result in the following output:

        &lt;p><br>
        This is a paragraph. There is an ordered list in this paragraph.<br>
        &lt;ol><br>
        &lt;li>This is the first item in my ordered list.&lt;/li><br>

        &lt;/html>
      </code>
      <br><br>

    <article>
      <p>
        In HTML, you might want certain &lt;p> elements to look different from other elements. You can do this by using classes and IDs. But what are classes and
        IDs? A class in HTML is used to change the way that any element looks. You can change the looks of &lt;p>, &lt;header>, &lt;ul> and any other element of your
        choice. Applying a class to multiple different elements will make all of them look the way that you styled them.
        <br>
        An HTML ID is slightly different. An ID is used to make an element look different from how the element is supposed to look. For example, you can make the size,
        colour and whatever else you want of a &lt;header> element, and then apply that ID to it. Doing this would make this specific &lt;header> look different from
        the other &lt;header> elements.

        This guide only covers the basics of HTML. There is still a lot to learn about the language and there are many useful tags not covered in this guide. If you
        wish to improve your skills and improve your HTML, I recommend doing <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/">
          the responsive web design course</a> on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a>. Once you have finished the course, you may wish to get
        certified. You can do this by completing a number of challenges where you design web pages. If you need help during this, I recommend to research the problem
        you have. You can use <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> and any other platform of your choice. You will also need to learn CSS, otherwise your website will not look very good. You can learn CSS via my <a href="https://codepen.io/nd003/full/PoOvmYK" target="_blank">CSS guide</a>.
        <br>
        Thank you for reading this guide. I hope that this guide improved your knowledge on HTML and programming in general.
